        <p>Are we ready for the ride of our life asked Bono, as Zoo Station opened up in Berlin tonight.<br>
            We were ready.<br>
            Two and a half months after this second night in Berlin was supposed to have taken place, it finally did.<br>
            'The last time I stood here I could not sing that song and you sang it for us...'<br>
            Bono was in fine voice tonight but everyone sang along anyway - and this time Berlin not only proved a fine ending to the entire tour,  it also recalled an extraordinary passage of 'experience' that was born in this city nearly thirty years ago.<br>
            '1990 was quite a moment to be in Berlin,<br>
            The wall had come down.. everywhere but in Hansa studios, recording Achtung Baby, and it wasn't going very well<br>
            In fact the walls were going up in the U2 band.<br>
            We couldn't' agree on anything where to eat, what to eat, who to eat… Brian Eno was questioning the utensils we were eating with.<br>
            Brian who built the table that we all we sat at..'<br>
            Brian Eno was in the house tonight and special thanks went out to him and Flood and Daniel Lanois.<br>
            'We came here not to find ourselves but to get lost… sometimes young men just need to get lost.'<br>

            We all got lost tonight...</p>

        <p>'This is where we live…'

            'This is where we live
            This is Dublin
            And even in the rain we think it's the greatest place on earth…
            … Thank you for coming out tonight
            The last of our four shows in our home town, the last show in our home town till God knows when
            Yeah.. It's a Beautiful Day alright.'

            Did the fourth night in Dub top the lot? If you were there you can tell us.

            Gloria stayed in the show along with Dirty Day but the night's surprise was Landlady, only the third live performance.
            Dublin was blessed. In fact, Dublin is blessed as Bono explained at the end of Get Out Of Your Own Way.

            'Blessed is Dublin for she is a broadsheet ballad.
            Blessed is the Rocky Road to Dublin
            Blessed is Raglan Road, where old ghosts meet
            Blessed is the Auld Triangle and the Royal Canal.
            Blessed is the corner of Beggars Bush
            Blessed is Waxie's Dargle.
            Blessed is the Foggy Dew.
            Blessed is the city of Luke Kelly and Ronnie Drew
            Blessed is the blue above the Europe we share and may the yellows stars never fall upon our heads
            Blessed is Dublin a great European city
            The Dublin of Shane McGowan, Jim Sheridan, Neil Jordan, Glen Hansard, Robbie Keane, Paul McGrath, Brian O'Driscoll, Katie Taylor, Mannix Flynn, and the Queen of Ireland Panti Bliss….'</p>
